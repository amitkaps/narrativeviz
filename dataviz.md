# Data Visualization

> _Graphical excellence is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space. - Edward Tufte_

The ever increasing computational capacity has enabled us to acquire, process and analyze larger data-sets and information. However, the human memory and attention required to use this data is more limited and has remained relatively constant. Data visualization can enable us to compress data and encode them in ways to aid perceptual, cognitive and emotional capacity required to comprehend, retain and make decisions using this data. This course is designed to help you learn the art and science of data visualization.

## Course Objectives

- Understand the value of data visualization and the role it plays in business analytics and decision making
- Learn the theory of data visualization including grammar, types, color, annotation, flow, animation, interaction etc.
- Build an understanding of visual perception and cognition to gain an intuitive sense of how data visualization work
- Get exposure to multiple tools that can be used to create data visualization
- Learn through practice the multiple contexts in which data visualization is used in business
	- Static visualization (say, adding a chart in a report)
	- Dashboard visualization (say, monitoring KPIs in a operational  or strategic dashboard)
	- Narrative visualization (say, telling a compelling data-story in a presentation)
	- Interactive visualization (say, allowing user to visually explore a complex data-set)

## Assessment
Learning is best achieved through participation and practice.
Attending the class sessions is a must to engage in a dialogue and learn from the question & answers and the sharing of experiences that happens. Further, there will be four assignments as part of the course. The first two assignments are individual and the next two assignments can be done in groups of two. The aim of the assignments is to provide you with a testing ground to put in practice all the theory and exemplars you would be learning about data visualization in the class.

- Class Participation (10%)
- Assignment #1 (individual): Visualization Critique (15%)
- Assignment #2 (individual): Static Visualization (25%)
- Assignment #3 (group): Dashboard Visualization (25%)
- Assignment #4 (group): Narrative or Interactive Visualization (25%)
