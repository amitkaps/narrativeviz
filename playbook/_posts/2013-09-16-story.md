## Storytelling and Leadership

Leadership is like a performing art – the equivalent of conducting a musical performance. The role of a leader at any given time is not to play the individual instruments but to unify the performance and to shape the sound of the ensemble. Leadership at its core is this ability to inspire, influence and persuade people. This cannot be achieved through dry analytical facts and figures or by just appealing to reason. The best way to lead and communicate to the team for a leader is to use the power of stories.

A story is something that comes from outside, but its meaning is something that emerges from within each one. And when this happens – it takes such a hold , that the meanings remains with us even after we let go of the story. Storytelling becomes this shared process between the teller and the listener. It can be used for leading and communicating values, insights, call-to-action, or vision and will easily cut across barriers of age, experience, skepticism and ideology. It becomes a personal act and creates this immutable connection with the listener at an emotional level.
