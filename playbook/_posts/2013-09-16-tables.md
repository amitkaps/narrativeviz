# Tables

A table is a structural way for displaying information, arranged in columns & rows and encoded as text. Tables have been used for more than two thousand years and is well understood by everyone.

## Types of Tables


## When to use tables?
Tables are inherently processed like text in a linear fashion. The row and the column structure allows you to easily look up and compare indiviual values. As the encoding is not visual but textual, there is no interpretation or translation required to understand it. You can provide as high a precision as needed for the numbers. And you can provide detailed as well as summary view of the same data. Further, multiple dimensions and units of quantiative data can be compressed in a single table.
