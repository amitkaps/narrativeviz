# Playbook

The playbook is my way to share how to tell visual stories with data by way of clear and thoughtfully organized lessons. I am offering 'plays' that have worked for me. I trust your judgement to decide which approaches might work better for you.

I am posting a lesson every couple of weeks. This is a draft outline and may change as the playbook is written. Please do [subscribe](http://eepurl.com/N326P) to get informed when the lessons are posted.

## Introduction
**[What is Telling Visual Stories with Data](/playbook/intro)** - A brief introduction to data visualization and storytelling

## Art of Observation

**Starting with Structure and Synthesis** - Where do we start from? Let us start by putting some structure around our data visualizations

**Learning the Basic Principles** - Let us understand the ground rules for designing a good visualization. We need to know the rules to break it. 

**Making Tables &amp; Graph** - It is surprising how often we represent data using different types of table and graphs. Do you know 
when to use which one?

**Visualizing Text** - We know that gaining insight from qualitative text is hard. However, thinking of ways to visualize text is even harder. Can we make it easy?

**Adding Interactivity** - We mostly stick to static visuals like in a text book. Why aren't data visualizations interactive and playful? 
		
## Art of Listening

**Making the Story Stick** - We have all heard stories right from our childhood. So what special ingredients do stories need to capture our attention?

**Developing your Story Spine** -  How do we translate the traditional story elements into our data-driven story? One way is to use the 'Story Spine' Structure

**Telling Stories with Data** - How do we bring this together? Let's map the elements of doing good storytelling and data visualisation in sync.

**Presenting with Impact** - We have all watched presentators that have captured the imagination of the audience. How do we ensure we have presence and impact when we are telling your data-stories?
