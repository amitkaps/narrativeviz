So what makes a data-story work? As part of ongoing research, we are using a case study based approach to map the four different layers in a data-story: See - Show - Tell - Engage. 

We are using this framework to articulate generic strategies that can be used for effective data-stories using exploratory and explanatory visualization in personal and presentation context.

The playbook is my way to share how to tell visual stories with data by way of clear and thoughtfully organized lessons. I am offering 'plays' that have worked for me. I trust your judgement to decide which approaches might work better for you.
